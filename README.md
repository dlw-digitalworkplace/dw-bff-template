# BFF Starter App

This is a starter application for a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) architecture. It provides a foundation for building a BFF that serves as an intermediary between frontend applications and backend services. This template includes:
- A front-end react application (using vite.js)
- A BFF application with cookie authentication
- A Web API that is OAuth2 authenticated
- Swagger for easy API testing

## Documentation
For detailed documentation on how to run this application, please see the [BFF Starter Template Wiki](https://github.com/dlw-digitalworkplace/dw-bff-template/wiki).

## Maintainer
This project is maintained by [agtenr](https://github.com/agtenr).

## Future improvements
* Improvement: Custom hook/provider in the front-end to keep authentication state
* Improvement: Clean-up downstream api calling (remove hardcoded string, move to service, ...)
* Improvement: Support for running the app as an MS Teams app
